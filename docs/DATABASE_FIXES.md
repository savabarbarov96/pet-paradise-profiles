# Pet Paradise Database Fixes

## Issue Summary

There was a mismatch between the application code and the database schema:

1. The application code was trying to insert data into a column named `behavior` (singular), but the interface defined it as `behaviors` (plural)
2. The database didn't have either of these columns
3. There were font inconsistencies across the application

## Solution Implemented

We've made the following changes to fix these issues:

### 1. Fixed Application Code

Updated `petProfileService.ts` to remove the reference to the non-existent `behavior` column in the database insert operation.

```typescript
// Before:
behavior: profile.behaviors || '',

// After:
// Column removed from insert operation
```

### 2. Added Database Migration Script

Created a database migration script that:
- Adds the `behaviors` column to the `pet_profiles` table if it doesn't exist
- Verifies and sets up the correct Row Level Security (RLS) policies

You can run this migration using the `run-migration.cmd` script in the root directory (Windows) or by running the SQL script manually:

```bash
# From the Supabase CLI
supabase db reset

# Or manually via psql
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d postgres -f ./supabase/migrations/20240601000000_fix_pet_profiles.sql
```

### 3. Improved Font Consistency

Added the required fonts to ensure consistent font usage across the application:
- `Inter` as the base sans-serif font (font-sans)  
- `Playfair Display` for display elements (font-display)
- `Caveat` for handwritten style text (font-handwritten)

### 4. Updated Documentation

- Updated `database-rules.mdc` with the correct schema definition and RLS policies
- Created this documentation file to explain the issues and solutions

## Database Schema

The current database schema for `pet_profiles` is:

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.pet_profiles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  traits TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}',
  bio TEXT DEFAULT '',
  birth_date DATE,
  death_date DATE,
  species TEXT DEFAULT 'other',
  breed TEXT DEFAULT '',
  color TEXT DEFAULT '',
  favorite_things TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}',
  featured_media_url TEXT,
  likes_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  memorial_message TEXT
);
```

After running the migration, the schema will include the `behaviors` column:

```sql
ALTER TABLE public.pet_profiles ADD COLUMN behaviors TEXT DEFAULT '';
```

## RLS Policies

The application requires the following RLS policies for the `pet_profiles` table:

```sql
-- Enable RLS on the pet_profiles table
ALTER TABLE public.pet_profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies for pet_profiles
CREATE POLICY "Public can view pet profiles" 
  ON public.pet_profiles FOR SELECT USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Users can create their own pet profiles" 
  ON public.pet_profiles FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own pet profiles" 
  ON public.pet_profiles FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own pet profiles" 
  ON public.pet_profiles FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

The migration script will verify and set up these policies if they don't exist.

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues after applying these fixes:

1. Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors
2. Verify the database schema matches the expected schema
3. Ensure all RLS policies are correctly set up
4. Check that the Supabase client is correctly configured in your application
